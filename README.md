## Background

This is a course project repository of Group 13 for Module Two of STAT 628 in University of Wisconsin - Madison in Fall 2020.

Our group members are: Hanlin Tang (sinnfashen), Yuhan Zhou (), and Robin Li ().

## Objective

The objective of this project is to come up with a "rule-of-thumb" based on some statistical analysis and models that can easily get a fat rate from some measures that are easier to acquire.

## File Structure

The data folder contains `BodyFat.csv` (which is the raw data about this module) and some other cleaned data.

The image folder contains some image output of our analysis.

The code folder contains our actual R codes, including analysis and shiny.
